### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Surveyor Engineer from [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) and currently working towards earning a Master's degree in Data Science from [NCSR "Demokritos"](http://www.demokritos.gr/) & [UoP](https://www.uop.gr/en/). I am mainly interested in Satellite Remote Sensing applications using Machine Learning tools


Since early 2021 I've been working in [Geosystems - Hellas](https://www.geosystems-hellas.gr/), as an engineer and project manager in R&D projects.
