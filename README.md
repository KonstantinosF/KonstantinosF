I am a Geomatics Engineer from [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) with a Master's degree in Data Science from [NCSR "Demokritos"](http://www.demokritos.gr/) & [UoP](https://www.uop.gr/en/). I am mainly interested in Satellite Remote Sensing applications using Machine Learning tools.
